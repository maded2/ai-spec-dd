**Story:** [PROJ-XXX - Story Title]  
**Test Type:** [Functional | Integration | Security | Performance]  
**Priority:** [High | Medium | Low]  
**Automated:** [Yes | No]

---

## Objective

[What this test validates, in 1 sentence.]

---

## Preconditions

- [Precondition 1: e.g., "User is authenticated"]
- [Precondition 2: e.g., "Test data exists in database"]
- [Precondition 3: e.g., "Service is deployed and healthy"]

---

## Test Data

| Field | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| User ID | `test-user-001` | Synthetic test user |
| Amount | `100.50` | Valid amount |
| Currency | `USD` | Valid currency |
| Recipient ID | `test-user-002` | Synthetic recipient |

## Test Steps

### Step 1: [Action]
**Given:** [Context]  
**When:** [Action taken]  
**Then:** [Expected result]

**Example:**
- **Given:** User is authenticated with valid token
- **When:** POST `/api/v1/transactions` with valid payload
- **Then:** Response is `201 Created` with transaction ID

### Step 2: [Action]
**Given:** [Context]  
**When:** [Action taken]  
**Then:** [Expected result]

---

## Expected Results

- [ ] HTTP status code: `201`
- [ ] Response body contains `id`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`, `createdAt`
- [ ] `status` field is `pending`
- [ ] Transaction is persisted in database
- [ ] Event published to Kafka topic `transactions.created`

---

## Actual Results

[To be filled during test execution]

---

## Pass/Fail Criteria

**Pass if:**
- All expected results are met
- No errors in application logs
- Performance within SLA (if applicable)

**Fail if:**
- Any expected result is not met
- Errors or exceptions in logs
- Performance degrades beyond SLA
